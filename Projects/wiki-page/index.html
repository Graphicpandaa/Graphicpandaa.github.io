      <b>Crown shyness</b> (<i>also canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</canopy shyness,sup>[2]</sup> or <i>inter-crown spacing</i> <sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crown 
      of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy wit|h channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species,
      </p>but also occurs between trees of different species. <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it 
      might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> 
            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branc|hes leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response.
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen i|n conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup>
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenc|ed by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branch|es greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the w|inds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism.                                                      |
